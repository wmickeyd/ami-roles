# Kenzan Build Pipeline Documentation

This repository contains scripts that provision, build and deploy infrastructure into Amazon AWS.

### Setting up Amazon AWS

---

####*Pre-Requites*

- Create credentials with enough permissions to deploy infrastructure into Amazon AWS
- Create IAM Role 'JenkinRole' in Amazon AWS account.(permissions to launch instance, remove instance)

- Ansible Installed (version: 1.9.2 or later) on the server from where the scripts are to be executed

[Scripts]

***script 1 - setup_vpc_subnets.yml***
```bash

```

	This script will create Security Group in the previously created VPC and will also creates keypair (generates file 'jenkins_access.pem')
		Note: Need to have vpc_id updated to the group_vars/all (which is done by script 'setup_vpc_subnets.yml')


***script 3 - launch_jenkins.yml***
```bash
	ansible-playbook -vvvv launch_jenkins.yml
```
	
	This script is used to launch Amazon AWS ami and then Install and Configure Jenkins on it
		Note: Need to have vpc_id and subnets.id updated to the group_vars/all (which is done by script 'setup_vpc_subnets.yml')

####Jenkins

***Provision other AMIs using Jenkins***

- After launch_jenkins.yml to configure and launch main jenkins
- Login to AWS account and search for instance labeled jenkins_main, get it's public IP, navigate to public IP using browser
- load Jenkin URL in browser
- Add git credentials to credential-store in jenkins
	Note:  Add Description as "GitHub", as the same is being refered in Jenkins DSL groovy scripts
- Edit the dsl-ami-proviosing job, select your github credentials and save the job (without this the job will fail)
- Trigger job 'dsl-ami-provisioning', which will create other 'base ami' jenkins jobs (jobs created by jenkins_ds/ami.groovy)
